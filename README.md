# Wordpress For A 2 Sided Market
Kits for a lockdown

I got this idea from something my daughter and grandson did with our [cultural activity](https://www.campkintail.ca/easter-in-a-basket/). Around the same time my wife did a zoom cookie decorating kit also with our cultural activity. I was reminded of a student in my user experience design class at Laurier that liked to decorate cakes and this idea was born.

We will create a wordpress plugin and a site that directs kit developers to fill out a form that says in 100 words why they would make interesting kits. Kit builders will be directed by the same plugin to a Woo Commerce store where they can purchase kits to make.

The parts of this project:

1. custom child theme with analytics, font and colors in the root css selector
2. 5 posts with media moved from the main page to be landing pages to help people to find kits from Google. Write the posts also with the editotial angle of how kits help deal with stress
3. 5 sample kit products with media in Woo Commerce
4. plugin for main page that takes a kit maker to the shopping page and kit developers to a registration page
5. a registration page with room for a 100 word summary of why the potential developer would provide good kits
6. as well as a starter plugin, this is a project for putting wordpress on qovery.com, a container as a service platform. Deploy this easily on qovery.com
