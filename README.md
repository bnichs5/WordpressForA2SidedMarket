# Wordpress For A 2 Sided Market
Kits for a lockdown

I got this idea from something my daughter and grandson did with our [cultural activity](https://www.campkintail.ca/easter-in-a-basket/). Around the same time my wife did a zoom cookie decorating kit also with our cultural activity. I was reminded of a student in my user experience design class at Laurier that liked to decorate cakes and this idea was born.

We will create a wordpress plugin and a site that directs kit developers to fill out a form that says in 100 words why they would make interesting kits. Kit builders will be directed by the same plugin to a Woo Commerce store where they can purchase kits to make.
